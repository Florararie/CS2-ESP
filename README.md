# CS2-ESP
Just a shoddily written ESP Cheat for CS2 in Python

---

## Features

- Enemy ESP (changes color based on which team the enemy is- blue for CT and orange for T)
- Health Bar
- Armor Bar
- Shows Player Name and Distance from your current position
- Draws Player Skeleton and highlights head location to help with aiming

## Usage
Just run while in-game and it will automatically create a click-through overlay that will only display ESP content while the game is focused.

## Things to note!
The overlay window is made using PyQt5- as such, it may occasionally have artifacting. I'm too lazy to fix this, so.. deal with it lol.
